In order to create the website, a site map has been constructed on the basis of a the basic structure to a website. This shows how the user will navigate through the site with ease and with very little to no difficulty:

![Site Map](assets/images/site-map.png)

### Template:

In order to create the main template (Wireframe) of the site, the appearance and aesthetics of the site had to be thought out whilst giving the user a positive experience alongside simple navigation.

![Site Template](assets/images/site-template.jpg)


### Colour Scheme:

The colour scheme inspired by the the main image that is from Destiny 2:

![Destiny Image](assets/images/collage.jpg)

In order to create the color palette, [Coolors](https://coolors.co/collage-maker) collage maker was used. The color scheme itself is quite muted intentionally to stay on theme with the identity of 'Destiny 2'.
Most of the written content is in a dark charcoal [#333333](#333333)to keep the written content as clear as possible and non-distracting.
A bright yellow [#F8DC57](#F8DC57) has selected to for the written content of the Benefits list against the grey background [#707070](#707070) to give it a higher level of importance in comparison to the standard written content on the page.

### Typography:

The main font used for the site is [Kanit](https://fonts.google.com/?query=kanit) and the back up font applied will be Sans-Serif should there be any issue with the font uploading.
[Kanit](https://fonts.google.com/?query=kanit) was chosen to for overall font to keep evyerything uniform. It was also chosen to resembe the font used for the game (Destiny 2) itself, so that it ties in together.

### Media:

The imagery used has been sorced from a selection of webites in relation to 'Destiny 2'. 
A single clip has been used to introduced and reperesent what is happening in the current season.

## Features

### Current Design Features:
- **Header** - appears on every page with clan logo
- **Navigation Bar** - appears at the top of every page along with the logo in the header to allow for easy navigation 

Both the Header and Navigation Bar are a fused feature on the site -[Header/ Nav Bar]('site-features/header.jpg')

- **Footer** - appears at the bottom of the bottom of every page, featuring social media icons (4), as links to keep the aesthetic clean and simple
[Footer]('site-features/footer.jpg')

- **Embeded Clip** - a clip relating to the content has been embeded to provide additional information on the current season of the game relating to the content
[Embedded Clip]('site-features/clip.jpg')

- **'Join Us' Form** - a form has been added to the join us page to allow the user to join the clan with as much clarity as possible
[Form]('site-features/form.jpg')

### Future Features:
Future design fetaures that could be incorporated:
- Attach sign up forms to the raid schedule
- Create a page to help with sub class set up, to provide more giudance to new comers
- Create a 'Thank you for joining page' for when the form is submitted to join the clan

The features above have not been implemented in the main release of the site due to lack of time to complete the page/ pages running up to submission.


## Issues & Bugs

- Struggled to position the Iframe (YouTube clip) and to allow it to be responsive
  - Used a div tag to center the iframe


  

### Testing

- Each page had gone through the [W3C Validator](https://validator.w3.org/) in order to make any bugs or erros that have been missed whilst building the site are caught before submission.

* [Home Page Results]('testing/index.html-result.jpg')

* [Raid Schedule Page]('testing/raids.html-result.jpg')

* [Join Us Page]('testing/joinus.html-result.jpg')

* [CSS Styling Page]('testing/css-styling-result.jpg')

After validating each page used for the site, no syntax errors are present.

Device Testing:

   - Apple iPad Air
   - Apple iPad Mini
   - iPhone SE
   - iPhone XR
   - Pixel 5
   - Samsung Galaxy S8+
   - Nest Hub
   - Nest Hub Max

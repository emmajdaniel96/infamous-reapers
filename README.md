## Introduction

This website was designed and created to advertise a gaming clan that is looking for new members to be apart of the Destiny 2 community.

This site is based on a gaming group that congragates online, daily to play Destiny 2 and help one another with different quest and challenges. This group is open and looking for fellow Guadians, bot rookie and veterans alike to join them in the mythic science fiction world of Destiny, which is an FPS (first-person shooter) multiplayer video game which is developed by Bungie, where Guardians of all races come together to protect the Light from Darkness which seeks to steal it at every turn.

This website was the first of the five milestone projects that is required for the completion of the Code Institute's Full Stack Software Development Course.
